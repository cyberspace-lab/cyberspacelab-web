Since high school I've been very interested in psychology and now I have the opportunity to get closer to it thanks to the Cyberspace lab. 

I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at the Faculty of Humanities at Charles University, where I am also working on my bachelor thesis focusing on spatial reasoning and board games. Besides that, I am very interested in personality psychology and video games, which I would like to use and maybe focus on it in the future.

In my free time, I like to play video games and also board games of various genres.
