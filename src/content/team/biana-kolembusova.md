I am a third-year bachelor’s student at the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University. I am currently working on my bachelor’s thesis, “Navigation in zero-g spaces while standing or laying down,” which focuses on the influence of body position on navigation in a virtual reality environment that simulates the lack of gravitational force on the International Space Station, with Lukáš Hejtmánek as my supervisor.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of cognitive psychology, space psychology and neuroscience particularly when combined with new technologies.

Cyberspacelab gives me many opportunities to develop technological and research-related skills and to learn more about psychology with a team of people who are all enthusiastic about virtual reality and video games.
