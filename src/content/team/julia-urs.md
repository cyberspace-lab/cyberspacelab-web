I am currently in my third year of the bachelor’s programme in Humanities and Social Sciences at the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague.
During my studies, I have developed an interest in the intricate workings of the human brain and devoted my time to psychology and the philosophy of mind. I have always been curious about how technology affects our cognitive abilities, so when I heard about CyberspaceLab, I instantly knew it was the right place for me.

For my bachelor’s thesis, under the guidance of our principal investigator Lukáš Hejtmánek, I will explore the world of augmented reality (AR) and its potential in informal education and climate change communication.
