I am currently a 2nd year bachelor student at the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague. I am an intern at cyberspace lab, where I help other members with their projects, which are mainly spatial cognition, virtual reality and gaming. I would like to continue doing this in the future. In my free time, I enjoy gaming and reading. I'm looking forward to learning more and contributing to the research group's projects.
