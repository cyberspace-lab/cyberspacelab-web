I am a fresh graduate of the master’s program Theoretical and experimental psychology at Faculty of Humanities in Prague. And I will be pursuing a doctorate in psychology.

In my previous studies I focused on locomotion methods in Virtual reality and how they affect navigation and spatial memory and also how the navigated environment can affect navigation and spatial memory. In my disertation I will study the transfer of knowledge from VR to reality and how immersion and presence can affect this transfer.

I love playing video games which is where my passion for virtual reality comes from. Other than that I play curling competitively and with my team we are currently in the czech extraleague. In curling i am currently the head coach of a junior team. In this semestr I also teach social psychology at PVSPS.
