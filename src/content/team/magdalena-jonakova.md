I am an undergraduate student currently studying Humanities at Charles University in Prague. During my high-school years, I have developed an interest in psychology. As an intern, I am excited to be part of the Cyberspace Lab research group because it allows me to interconnect it with another big passion of mine, video games. I'm particularly interested in learning how technology, such as virtual reality, can offer us new and fascinating ways to understand and enhance our cognitive performance.
I enjoy single-player games of many different genres, including RPGs, action-adventure, and simulations. Exploring virtual worlds, immersing myself in fascinating storylines, and challenging my skills is what I love the most about video games.
