I used to study IT at secondary school and was planning to continue to do so at university. But after a while I found out that humans are a bit more interesting subject than computers, so I went to try study humanities with a focus on psychology. Still, I enjoy using technology, so I try my best to fuse IT and psychology together. Now I am undergraduate student at Faculty of Humanities, Charles University. I am now in my 4th year just trying finish my bachelor thesis.

My current line of research is focused on spatial audio and how it interacts with navigation, specifically how it all connects to different types of movements in VR. In my real time i really enjoy learning about artificial neural networks and new gaming technology. I really enjoy single player videogames with interesting stories, mechanics and words.
