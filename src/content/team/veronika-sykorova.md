I am a 3rd year student at the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague. I am conducting my bachelor’s thesis under the supervision of Lukáš Hejtmánek. The line of research shall be based on the topic of  forest bathing or shinrin-yoku (森林浴), specifically how different forest structures affect relaxation and well-being of people.

During my internship here I got introduced to many opportunities of combining technology and psychology. I am fascinated by my labmates´ projects, and how they include video games in their psychological research. My time at the lab has opened my eyes to the many possibilities and I can't wait to learn more.
