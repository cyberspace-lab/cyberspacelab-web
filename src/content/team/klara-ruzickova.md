I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Humanities at Charles University. My love for psychology developed during my high school days where I studied Social Welfare and I found myself gravitating towards the subject. My passion for the field has only grown stronger as I continue to delve deeper into the intricacies of the human mind.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I spent a year studying Korean at a language school before starting to work on my degree, which may highlight my passion for exploring different cultures and languages. When I am not studying, I like to unwind by playing video and board games as I finds it as a great way to relax and have fun with friends and family.
