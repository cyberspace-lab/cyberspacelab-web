This project deals with the topic of climate change and its communication, while examining the use of emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR) as a communication medium.

Climate change is a topic that has remained in the global discourse for a long time; however, many aspects of climate change and the processes contributing to the warming of the planet are beyond our sensory perception. Our goal is to determine whether AR, as a new medium, can better visualize and convey information related to climate change compared to traditional media such as printed text or graphics.

The results of scientific studies are quite inconclusive. While some found that AR can help individuals to better understand phenomena invisible to the human eye, other studies did not.

The research aim is to verify whether the use of AR leads to a higher level of acquired knowledge in the context of informal environmental education. For this purpose, an exhibition will be created and enhanced with interactive elements through AR. The results could contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of AR within informal education (i.e., exhibitions, museums) and expand the scientific knowledge base in the field of climate change communication.
