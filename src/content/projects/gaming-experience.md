Playing games is popular all over the world, across different age groups. At the same time, it has been proven in many studies that playing games has positive consequences on many areas of human life. Research shows that playing games can improve cognitive functions such as visual attention, visual short-term memory, processing speed, and mental rotation. However, most research is plagued by a number of methodological problems. One of these problems is the fact that researchers often do not take into account individual aspects of gaming, such as participantsâ€™ gaming history, gaming platforms, or genres of video games. These aspects can have an impact on many cognitive skills.

Based on the research of previous studies, it seems that this is where the core of the research problem lies, as researchers often use outdated or oversimplified questionnaires. However, the video game industry is developing every day, the aspects of playing games are more complex, and we cannot be satisfied with the conventional division of games into action, racing etc.

This project serves as an umbrella for several research initiatives that explore different aspects of video game play. These include studies on the cognitive effects of gaming, the development of new tools for measuring gaming experience, and investigations into how different gaming habits shape perception, attention, and decision-making. By combining insights from psychology, cognitive science, and game studies, the project aims to better understand how interactive digital environments influence the human mind.
