This project deals with locomotion methods in virtual reality. It focuses on the impact of these methods on navigation and spatial memory. VR locomotion methods or VR locomotion are technologies, which allow us to move through the virtual environment. However many locomotion methods cause disorientation or even nausea. Therefore, choosing the appropriate locomotion method is an important aspect of any study or experience using VR.

The project started as Oliver’s bachelor thesis. Two locomotion methods (teleportation and teleportation with optic flow) were compared in an experiment in virtual apartments. In the first part, the task was to navigate in the apartments and find assigned objects. In the second part of the experiment, the task was to point to the positions of these objects in an empty environment with only one reference point. The other part of the procedure was conducted using questionnaires that focus on VR motion sickness and VR locomotion method preference. We followed up on this project in Oliver’s diploma. Using similar methodology we added different sizes and complexities of the navigated environments to see if the examined locomotion methods can have a bigger impact in small and large environments and also in complex and simple spaces.

The results from the first project showed a significant difference only in the time required to complete the first part of the experiment, which focused on navigation skills – teleportation with optical flow has proven to be faster. Differences in traveled distance, spatial memory, VR sickness and preference of locomotion method from the results were not proven. Similarly in the second experiment we found that participants navigated faster with optic flow. Also participants showed better spatial memory after navigating in less complex environments. 

Recently we conducted another study with the same design as in the diploma thesis to gather additional data. We are currently preparing a paper with additional analyses.
