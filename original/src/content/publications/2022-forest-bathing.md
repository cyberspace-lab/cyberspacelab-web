  Forest environments have been proven beneficial for physiological well-being, supporting relaxation and meditative processes. Unfortunately, some groups, predominantly  those  with  reduced  mobility,  are  prevented  from  forest visitation. Presenting such environments in virtual reality could provide a viable  substitute.  However,  as  forest  structure  and  composition  are important  aspects  of  its  restorative  power,  to  accurately  compare  the efficacy  of  virtual  forests  to  that  of  real  natural  spaces,  the  virtual environment  should  match  the  real  location  as  closely  as  possible. Furthermore, if participants achieve similar benefits in both settings, virtual copies (digital twins) of forests could be a viable option for studying forest bathing in a controlled environment. We collected LiDAR scans of a forest location near Prague, took spatial audio recordings of the forest ambiance, and built the forest’s digital twin in Unreal Engine. To compare the therapeutic efficacy of the virtual forest with its real counterpart, groups of volunteers spent half an hour in either the real forest, the virtual forest, or both. We collected participants’demographic and psychometric data, assessing their relaxation, emotional state, and cybersickness before and after the session. Our data show an  increase  in  relaxation  with  no  significant  differences  between  the environments, although participants’ emotional states did not improve in either condition. We found that participants’experiences were comparable between the environments, but cybersickness limited the potential efficacy of virtual forest bathing. The limitations of the virtual forests as a platform for research into forest bathing are discussed.
